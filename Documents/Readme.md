-# Overview
 -A Haskell Grader (AHG) is an automated grading system built in Haskell and using QuickCheck where professors can upload homework
 -assignments with a specified format into a Git repo.  Students will pull the repo and push their homework solutions to their respective
 -branch.  AHG will use QuickCheck to create test cases and verify student's solutions. It will then post their grade to the the student's branch
 -and automatically email them that their homework has been graded.  
 -
 -All of this is enabled by using [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/).  Gitlab must be configured approapriately to work with AHG.  These configurations
 -are located in the document titled: "Gitlab Documentation.txt" located in the AHG repo. 
 -
 -# Motivation
 -This is a collaborative project between student and professor, Michael Townsend and Dr. Harley Eades, respectively.  Michael was looking
 -for a summer project and Dr. Eades wanted a system like AHG to help with grading the many Haskell assignments in his Programming Languages class.
 -We decided to use Haskell because well it's a cool language! That's not the only reason. Michael was looking for a projects to sharpen his 
 -Haskell skills and Dr. Eades is a veteran Haskell-er.  We thought this would be a good project to show how Haskell can be integrated into
 -common tools (Gitlab) while leveraging Haskell's libraries (QuickCheck) to make a powerful system.
